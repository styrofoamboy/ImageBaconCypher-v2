# ImageBaconCypher-v2

A revision of my original ImageBaconCypher proof-of-concept.
This version has a much cleaner interface, and what (I hope) to be a better encryption,
based on an HMAC'd Rijndael (AES) encryption algorythm.

This will requeire the following libraries from the RainstormStudios repo and are not included with this repo:
*RainstormStudios
*RainstormStudios.Controls
*RainstormStudios.Drawing
